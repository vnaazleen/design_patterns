# Observer Pattern
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many
dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all of its dependents are
notified and updated automatically.

```
Publishers + Subscribers = Observer Pattern
```

* Observer pattern is is similar to newspaper or magazine subscriptions
    * A newspaper publisher goes into business and begins
    publishing newspapers.
    * You subscribe to a particular publisher, and every time there’s a new edition it gets delivered to you. As long as you remain a subscriber, you get new newspapers.
    * You unsubscribe when you don’t want papers anymore,
    and they stop being delivered.
* In Observer pattern, we call the publisher
the **SUBJECT** and the subscribers the **OBSERVERS**.
