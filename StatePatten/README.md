# State Pattern


# State machines 101
State machine to Code 
1. Gather up the states.
2. Create an instance variable to hold the current state, and define values for each of the states.
3. Gather all the actions that can happen in the system.
4. Now we create a class that acts as the state machine. For each action, we create a method that uses conditional statements to determine what behavior is appropriate in each state.
